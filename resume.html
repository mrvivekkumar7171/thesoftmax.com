    - tell a story about yourself why should them hire you
    - make different resume for different type of companies and different roles/profiles like (AI/ML/Data Science etc.)
    - Get 1 point to click (one project that must be the best and amazing and complex and must contain super learning and best practices)
    - Also talk about transferable skills (problem solving, critical thinking, team building etc. which you have learnt from previous job experience or projects)
    - which must contains your bio, resume, skills, and contact details
1. Use an elegant text font
    a. Good examples: Calibri, Times New Roman, Arial, Verdana, Cambria, Tahoma, Georgia 
    b. Bad examples: Comic Sans MS, MS Gothic, Ink Free, Agency FB, OCR A Extended

Cover Letter : (Never miss this and must be job specific/personalize, use your own words)(It can include your achievements, why you are fit for the job, how much you know about the company)
    Dear Trent,
    I've wanted to work for Valens Securities for several years. Your take on the limitations of GAAP fits perfectly with my skill set. I believe my work with data-regression models for company P/Es would be extremely valuable in your quest to adjust for accounting
    anomalies. My achievements include..

General Points : 
    Get multiple feedback before sending for job (use ChatGPT)
    No typos in the resume (use Grammarly to correct grammar and spelling mistakes)
    Hide things that you are not confident of 
    Save and share resume in pdf format only
    Don't use dark Theme for resume when printing

    example: 
            https://www.kunalgohrani.info/my-resume
            https://natassha.github.io/natasshaselvaraj/
            https://zety.com/blog/data-scientist-resume-example

    it is important to present different types of projects on your resume. Most data science positions require you to be skilled in multiple areas — data collection, analysis, machine learning, and visualization.

Here are a few areas that you should pay particular attention to when creating projects:

Data collection, pre-processing, and analysis —As a data scientist, a majority of your time will be spent collecting and munging large amounts of data. Showcase your ability to extract external data with the help of tools such as BeautifulSoup and Python APIs. Use libraries like Pandas to clean and query dataframes. Here is a tutorial that will teach you how to scrape external data in Python, and if you want to go more in-depth with this topic here’s a Data Pre-Processing with Pandas course I highly recommend.
Solve a business problem — A data scientist’s strength lies in their ability to answer questions with the help of data. Very often, you will be tasked with helping companies solve business problems. A machine learning model is just a tool that helps you do this and there is a clear distinction between ML, data analytics and business analytics. Develop a project with real-world business application. Here is a customer segmentation tool I built in Python that you can draw inspiration from. If you have data science experience but don’t know how to use it to add value to organizations, you can check out this Business Analytics course to get started.
